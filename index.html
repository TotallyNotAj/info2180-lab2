                <h2>House Can Skate?</h2>

                <p>"House can skate pon eh toll? House can driff?" This is a common rhetorical question asked by numerous indiviudals
                    in Jamaica, in the rapidly expanding car scene. It's a given that no form of real estate can do either, however, sports cars are able
                    to do both. Some even claim it's possible to live in a sports car, where they'd rather have a GLE or a Mark X over a
                    comfortable beach side villa with a pool and ac. As a young male growing up in this generation, given all this exposure, it's almost
                    as if it was pre-determined genetic coding that I would develop a strong interest in sports cars and racing, and that
                    strong interest is part of what motivates me to push through university to get my degree.</p>

                <p>Growing up, my parents didn't own any fancy or expensive sports cars, but that did not stop me from developing an interest in
                   cars at a young age. Prior to kindergarten, I was given a PSP gaming console, along with the game burnout legends. This could
                   be seen as the start of my love for cars, as I quickly grew addicted to the game, getting 100% completion 4 different times prior to
                   entering first grade. As I aged, my love for cars grew faster than I did as other games and real life experiences progressively wired my brain. Getting
                   access to the entire Forza Horizon pentalogy, along with numerous Need for Speed games (especially NFS Most Wanted), paired with
                   being allowed to drive in my classmates tuned Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X and my godfather's 350z made me realize cars are like the best
                   thing since sliced bread. When I graduate University, and get a stable enough income to afford it, I plan to buy numerous hyper, super and 
                   sports cars for collection and for the driving experience. Unlike others, I'd make sure to invest in real estate first though.

                <h2>Those Beyond the Sea</h2>

                <p>"Beyond the walls... there's a sea. On the other side of the sea... there's freedom - that's what I always believed.
                    Growing up in a developing country, brain drain is a major issue as time progresses. From teachers leaving during the academic year,
                    to doctors and nurses leaving, the country being put in harsh predicaments and hospitals being understaffed. However, as 
                    beautiful as a nation Jamaica is, it's almost a given to happen for most job fields. As a child, I originally wanted to be
                    an astronaut, a wish of being the first Jamaican to go to space. Growing up that bubble was swiftly popped, discovering that 
                    one must be an American citizen to be an astronaut at NASA.</p>

                <p>This discovery is what pushed me into the field of Computer Science and Software Development, in hopes of becoming
                    an Aeronautical Engineer. However, similar to the ideal lifestyle stated in the blog "House Can Skate?", one cannot
                    achieve that lifestyle while working in this country. Having a 100% import tax on cars, a high cost of living in comparison
                    to one's annual income until you get a high position at a good job, along with a slowly failing economy. These factors pushed
                    me into going to university overseas at first, but I chose to remain here since the degree is acredited regardless. However, 
                    the life I want is ideal that I get a well-paying job overseas. But is that all there is to it? Would it really be so easy to migrate
                    and start a whole new life in a whole new country? As a child it seemed that was the scenario, but as the world is today it appears that
                    is the complete opposite.
